# SnakeNeon – Neon Arcade Snake Game

SnakeNeon is a browser-based arcade Snake game built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, combining classic Snake gameplay with a modern neon-themed user interface. The project focuses on clean game logic, smooth keyboard controls, glowing visuals, and a simple yet engaging arcade experience.

The game starts with a login screen where players enter their username. Player data such as the current user and high score is stored using **LocalStorage**, allowing progress to persist across sessions without any backend. The main game arena is built using **CSS Grid**, while JavaScript handles movement, collision detection, score updates, and sound effects.
